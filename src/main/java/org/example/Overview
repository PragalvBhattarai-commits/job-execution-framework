Problem Context:
You are building a job execution framework similar to what schedulers (Airflow, Quartz, Kubernetes Jobs) do internally.
All jobs follow the same lifecycle, but each job performs different work.

Functional Requirements:

Every job must:
Initialize resources
Execute business logic
Handle cleanup
Report status

Different job types:
Data Import Job
Report Generation Job
Email Notification Job
